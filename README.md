# White Blood Cell Classification Model

The dataset for this file can be found at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bzhbzh35/peripheral-blood-cell

The Notebook contains the complete implementation of the CNN Model for Predicting Cells.

Complete Image Processing , Resizing and then converting images to vectors.

Then Encoding the Labels.

Then Creating the CNN Model Architecture and then fitting the training data into it and getting reuslts.

Then we exported the Model and from that model we predicted the test Images.
