# White-Blood-Cell-Classification-Deep-Learning-Approach-for-Medical-Imaging


## ðŸ“Œ Objective
Leverage computer vision and deep learning to automate the classification of white blood cell types from microscopic imagesâ€”enhancing efficiency in medical diagnostics.

## ðŸ§° Tools & Libraries
Python

TensorFlow / Keras

OpenCV

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib

Scikit-learn

## ðŸ“‚ Workflow Overview
### ðŸ“¥ 1. Data Loading & Preprocessing
Read image files using os and cv2

Resized all images to 64x64 for model consistency

Normalized pixel values for improved convergence

### ðŸ”Ž 2. Data Exploration & Label Encoding
Visualized sample images for insight into class distribution

Converted categorical labels to one-hot encoded format using pandas and keras.utils.to_categorical

### ðŸ”€ 3. Train-Test Split
Used train_test_split to split data for training and validation

### ðŸ§  4. CNN Model Architecture
Implemented a Sequential CNN using:

Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Dropout, Dense

Compiled with:

Loss: categorical_crossentropy

Optimizer: adam

### ðŸ“Š 5. Model Training & Evaluation
Trained over multiple epochs

Visualized training accuracy and loss

Compared predictions vs. actual labels for performance review

### ðŸ’¾ 6. Model Saving & Inference
Saved trained model using tf.saved_model.save

Reloaded and used the model for prediction on test data
